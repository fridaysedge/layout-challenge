Style Sheet Changes 

*** Formatting for All Devices ***

	- [COMPLETE] The background image on the body should be applied only when the width is 992px and wider; narrower devices should not have a background image, as the content will fill the entire width of the screen

	- [COMPLETE] The margins you used to apply to the main page content element should be applied only when the width is 992px or wider; on narrower devices, the page content should fill the entire width of the screen

	- [COMPLETE] The font size on the body should be reduced to 16px (we will increase it to 18px on larger screens)

	- [COMPLETE] The Bootstrap .container-fluid rule will apply a top and bottom margin to the element, but we want that element to be right up against the top of the page on small screens, so create a rule with the same class selector and set the top and bottom margins to 0

	- [COMPLETE] The tag line ('Feeding Hungry Huskies Since 2013') should be displayed only when the width is 992px or wider; on narrower screens that element should not be displayed

	- [COMPLETE] The <ul> element within the <nav> element should have padding and margins of 0 on all sides

	- [COMPLETE] The <li> elements within the <nav> element should have no bullets, should be displayed as inline-block elements, and should have a right margin of 1em

	- [COMPLETE] The navigation hyperlinks themsleves should have the color #55E, but that should change to #00E when the readers hovers the mouse over or sets focus to them

*** Formatting for Medium and Large Screens (992px and Wider) ***

When the screen size is 992px or larger, apply the following additional formatting:

	- [COMPLETE] As was noted above, the body background image should be applied for these sized screens, in exactly the same way as you did for the previous challenge

	- [COMPLETE] Also as noted above, the tag line should be displayed for these sized screens

	- [COMPLETE] The body font size should also be increased to 18px

	- [COMPLETE] The Bootstrap .container-fluid rule should be altered to set the left margin to 30%, and the top, right, and bottom margins to 20px

	- [COMPLETE] The entire <nav> element should be positioned 10px from the top and right of the page header element
